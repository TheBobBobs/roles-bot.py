'''Bot needs `AssignRoles` and `React` permissions!
The bot can only assign roles lower than it's highest role.
If a user is ranked above the bot it cannot give them roles.

Create a reaction message by mentioning the bot with the text you want it to send:

<@01G9XW2NR0QBH5SD3RMDX7VWDB>
`{ROLE:Rust}` the bot will replace this in the next step
you can put roles anywhere `{ROLE:Python}` in the message


You can then react to the message with the emojis you want.
When you're done react with the checkmark.

The above example would look like this when done:

:01GAR9TW0FGMH680JM2C0P0Y02:[](ROLE_ID) __Rust__ the bot will replace this in the next step
you can put roles anywhere :01GAR81WB2HZQ4DZTQ0MWCFHJC:[](ROLE_ID) __Python__ in the message [](https://autumn.revolt.chat/attachments/XdgyLo8Su2sVmuguEh8QQS21Z_vqS7MHG0Ho74LW9G/roles.mp4)'''
